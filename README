This game is styled a bit like The Price is Right but a little different. You have three prize packs to choose.
You can select a trip to Hawaii, a new car, or a gameroom.
Once you select it, you need to guess how much it costs (within 0-$9999).
The computer will generate an amount for the prize.
If you get the price exactly right then you win all the prizes.
If you are within $1000, then you just win the prize you chose.
If you are more than $1000 off then you win nothing.

The second half of the game has you guess the price of a dishwasher, digit by digit. The game will give you hints
to help you guess the next number.
