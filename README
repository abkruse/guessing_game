This game is styled a bit like The Price is Right but a little different. You have three prize packs to choose.
You can select a trip to Hawaii, a new car, or a gameroom.
Once you select it, you need to guess how much it costs (within 0-$9999).
The computer will generate an amount for the prize.
If you get the price exactly right then you win all the prizes.
If you are within $1000, then you just win the prize you chose.
If you are more than $1000 off then you win nothing.

The second half of the game has you guess the price of a dishwasher, digit by digit. The game will give you hints
to help you guess the next number.


Tristan's notes:

We cleaned up some of code and tried to simplify. We also added a total prize package feature. Now you can see your total winnings at the end of the game! and boy, is it great! Unless your earnings are $0. Then it's a real slap in the face.
